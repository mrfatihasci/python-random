Python code to study english vocabulary using a bunch of libraries 

				Description:

The aim of writing this python code was to study the english vocabulary word that were copied and pasted to excel file from web.
What it basically does is to retrieve each cell datas of a column, translates it with google translate's library and pops up in the screen for user to enter the turkish translate of it.
When the answer is correct, it is marked as true (sets value as 1 to next column) and does not ask it next time.
When the answer is wrong, it is marked as wrong (sets value as 0 to next column) and keeps asking it each time the python code is run. It includes PYTTSS3 library to aid the english listening skill of user.

				Note:
This code was written during time of my english language study as a hobby, so the code can be shortened and improved but i stopped working on it when it was working just fine :)
